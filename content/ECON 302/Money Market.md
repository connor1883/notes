## Money Demand
[[Money#Money Demand|definition]]
### Money Demand Function
$$
M^{D}= P[L(Y,i)]
$$
$P:$ price level
$Y:$ real income or output
$i:$ nominal interest rate on nonmonetary assets
$L:$ function relating $M^D$ to $Y$ and $i$

>can also write like this:

$$
\frac{M^D}{P}=L(Y,r+\pi^e)
$$
$\frac{M^D}{P}$: Real Money Demand
$r:$ real interest rate on nonmonetary assets
$\pi^e:$ expected inflation rate

### Factors that affect Money Demand

>[!example]+ Nominal interest rate on nonmonetary assets
>- Higher nominal interest rate $\implies$ larger cost of holding money
>- Nominal interest rate $\uparrow \implies M^D\downarrow$

> [!example]+ Real income
>-  Higher real income increases desired consumption
> >Number of desired transaction increases
> 
> - Real income $\uparrow \implies M^D \downarrow$

>[!example]+ Price Level
>- Higher price level means more money needed for transactions
>- Price Level $\uparrow \implies M^{D}\uparrow$

***and also***

- Risk of nonmonetary asset returns
	- Risk $\uparrow \implies M^D \uparrow$
- Liquidity of nonmonetary assets
	- Liquidity $\uparrow \implies M^D \downarrow$
- Expectations of nonmonetary asset returns
	- Expected return $\uparrow \implies M^D \downarrow$


## Money Supply
 [[money#Money Supply|Definition]]

### Money Market Equilibrium

given by: $M^D = M^S$
$$
M^{S}= P \times L(Y,i)
$$
$P:$ price level
$i:$ nominal interest rate on nonmonetary assets

>At aggregate level for nonmonetary assets:

$$
M^{D}+NM^{D}= M^S + NM^S
$$
$$
EQ\implies(M^{D}- M^S) + (NM^{D}- NM^{S})= 0
$$
$M:$ money
$NM:$ nonmonetary assets

> [!info] Price Level increases with Money Supply if Y flat
> $M^S \uparrow \implies P \uparrow$ if $Y$ unchanged

### Quantity Theory of Money
$$
MV = PY
$$
$M:$ Money supply
$P:$ Price level
$Y:$ real income or real GDP of economy
$V:$ Velocity of money $\left(V= \frac{PY}{M} \right)$

>[!example] Quantity theory implications
> - Assumes real money demand proportional to real income
> - Assumes V is constant
> - If change in M doesn't affect Y $\implies$ Y determined by tech and resources
> - P changes same percentage as M
### Factors that affect Money Supply
determined by FED

**Open-Market Operations**
> Purchase and sale of treasuries by the FED
> primary tool of FED to control $M^S$

> [!Example] Sale of Bonds
> - Public buys bonds
> - ==**decreases**== money supply

> [!Example] Purchase of Bonds
> - Fed pays public using newly created money
> - ==**increases**== money supply
