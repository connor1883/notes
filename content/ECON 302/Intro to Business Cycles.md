### What are Business Cycles

> Fluctuations of **aggregate economic activity**
> > not just single economic variable

![[Pasted image 20240317200551.png|400]]

**Expansion**: Trough to Peak  
**Contraction:** Peak to Trough  

> Business cycles are *recurrent* but not *periodic*

### Predicting Business Cycles

>[!example]+ Leading Variables
> - Tend to fluctuate in advance of overall economy
> - Examples:
> 	- manufactures new orders of goods and materials
> 	- average weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance

**Problems with leading variables:**
- Macroeconomic data often revised
- No single leading variable can perfectly predict business cycles

> [!example]+ Coincident Variables
>  - Fluctuate simultaneously with overall economy
>  - Four major:
> 	 - Industrial production
> 	 - Manufacturing and trade sales
> 	 - nonfarm employment
> 	 - real personal income

>[!example]+ Lagging Variables
> Tend to fluctuate after the changes in overall economy
>- CPI, Wages, Nominal interest rate

### Comovement of Variables

>Tendency of many economic variables to move together in a predictable way over the business cycle

**Three kinds of comovement:**

>[!example]- Procyclical
> Variables move in **same** direction as aggregate economic activity
>- real GDP, consumption, investment

>[!example]- Countercyclical
> Variables move in **opposite** direction of aggregate economic activity
> - Unemployment


Okun's Law:  
$$
\frac{Y-\bar Y}{\bar Y} = -2(u-\bar u)
$$

$\bar u:$ natural rate of unemployment  
$\bar Y:$ full-employment output  

>Thus a 1 percentage point increase in U $\implies$ 2% reduction in output relative to $\bar Y$  


>[!example]- Acyclical
> Variables that **do not have a clear pattern** over business cycle
> - Real interest rate
