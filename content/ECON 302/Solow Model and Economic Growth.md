$$\frac{\Delta Y}{Y} = \frac{\Delta A}{A} + \alpha_k \frac{\Delta K}{K} + \alpha_N \frac{\Delta N}{N}$$

### SOLOW MODEL
- NX = 0, G = 0
- production function constant returns to scale

$k_t:$ Capital-Labor ratio

Production Function: (per worker)
$$y_{t}= f(k_t)$$
![[Pasted Image 20240224210728.png|400]]

diminishing MPK

Aggregate demand (per worker): $y_t = c_t + i_t$

Savings where s is saving rate
$c_{t}= (1-s)y_t$

investment(per worker): $i_{t}= y_{t}- c_{t} \implies sf(k_t)$


![[Pasted Image 20240224211023.png|300]]

Capital stock next period (**Capital Accumulation Equation**):
$$k_{t+1}= k_{t}+ sf(k_{t})-\delta k_t$$
>$$\Delta k_{t}=i_{t}-\delta k_t$$

steady state occurs when $sf(k^*)=\delta k$, where $k^*$ is the steady state $k_t$
- intersection of these two curves

Golden Rule capital labor ratio (maximizes consumption per worker):
$c^*$ maxed when $f'(k^{*})=\delta$

>complicated stuff here

#### Adding population growth

**Capital Accumulation Equation:**

$$\Delta k_{t}= i_{t}- (n+ \delta) k_{t}$$

Solow Model with Pop Growth:
$$k_{t+1}- k_{t}= i_t-(n+\delta)k_t$$
Steady state at: $sf(k^*) = (n+\delta)k^*$

at steady state:
$$k^{*}= \left(\frac{s}{n+\delta}\right)^\frac{1}{1-\alpha}$$
higher $n$ decreases $k_t$ at steady state

**Golden Rule $k_t$:** $f(k^*)(\delta + n)k^*$
$$f'(k^*_{g})=n+\delta$$
### COMPARATIVE STATICS
$s \uparrow:$ initially at steady state so no change, after savings increases $\frac{\Delta k}{k} >0$$\implies k^*$ increases, then back to steady state

- higher savings rate has ==*level*== effect **not** *growth* effect

- positive relationship between savings rate and income per capita

$n \uparrow:k^{*}\downarrow$ therefore also lower output per worker
-this is just one relationship:
 - obviously this is not entirely accurate because it ignores contribution to pension, innovation, tech advancement, higher pop growth means more scientists, inventors, engineers...

**Case Studies**
War: (ceteris paribus)
decline in K:
- k and y fall, high growth as $k\rightarrow k^*$
decline in population:
$k\uparrow$: k will decrease down to k*
period of contraction

**Productivity Change:**
assuming $f(k)=Ak^\alpha$
$A \uparrow:$ production function shifts up. $k_{t} \uparrow$ and remains at higher level steady state: $k\uparrow, y \uparrow$ (one time effect)
>this is the same effect as $s \uparrow$

**Balanced Growth**
- Y, K, C grow at same rate
- steady state exhibits this as they all grow at $n$
- balanced growth implies (capital-output ratio) $\frac{K}{Y}$ is constant

**Convergence**
- Solow model predicts *conditional convergence*
	- converge if same steady state

### AK Model/Endogenous Growth

Prod.
$$Y_{t}= AK_t$$
same per worker

- constant returns to scale
>>>==**MPK constant (not diminishing)**==

**Supply of Goods and Services:** 
>$y_{t}= Ak_t$

**Demand for Goods and Services:**
>$y_t=c_t+i_t$

**Given fixed saving rate:**
>$i_{t}= sy_{t}= sAk_t$

#### Capital Accumulation Equation
$$k_{t+1}-k_{t}= sAk_{t}- (n+\delta)k_{t}$$
essentially no steady steady state $(sA = n+\delta)$

#### Growth rate of $y_t$
$$\frac{\Delta y_t}{y_{t}}=\frac{\Delta k_t}{k_{t}}=sA-(n+\delta)$$
$y_t$ will grow forever if $sA>n+\delta$

savings rate affects long run growth rate of output

### Growth Policies
"best" savings rate is golden rule, US is not saving enough

Policies to incentivize private savings:
- lower tax, which $\uparrow r$: $r=(1-\tau)i-\pi^e$
	- small effect due to effect on lifetime income
Policies to increase Government savings
- raise taxes or cut spending
	- spending hard to reduce
	- $\tau \uparrow$ won't effect natl. savings under Ricardian Eq.
	>countries have to endure a decline in consumption before reaching the golden rule steady state

Policies to raise productivity:
- improve infrastructure
	- net-zero effect due to crowding out private investment
- build human capital
	- education, worker training and relocation programs, health programs
- R&D
	- grants, funding gov research, tax incentives, support for scientific education


### Additional Considerations
#### Institutions
real income per capita correlated with institutional quality
improvements in institutional quality reduce growth volatility
good institutions have regulatory framework to protect investors -> promotes investment

#### Free Trade
geographic differences can be used to study because they are correlated with trade and not other stuff
$2\% \uparrow$ Trade/GDP$\implies1\% \uparrow$ GDP per capita 
- trade gives access to foreign tech, know-how, and investment
- comparative advantage
#### Poverty Trap

each period there is fixed amount of income that must be consumed  $\theta N_t$ between 0 and 1 
cap acc.

$$\Delta k_t = sAk_t^\alpha-s\theta-(n+\delta)k_t$$

Steady States:
- no intersection
	- no steady state
- tangent 
	- one steady state
- two steady states

![[Pasted Image 20240226175413.png|300]]
countries that start poor will remain poor

>Policy to break this trap:

big-push - increased aid and investment from foreign countries
