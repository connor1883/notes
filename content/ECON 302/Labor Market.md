Firm optimal hiring:
marginal product of labor = real wage  $(MPN = w)$

**MPN downward sloping** due to diminishing MPN

MPN curve is **same** as Labor demand curve
how to draw labor demand curve:
1) draw MPN curve
2) for given $w$, find quantity of N demanded
3) change $w$ level and repeat 2

#### Shifts of Labor Demand Curve


### Labor Supply
Ind: relationship between *CURRENT* $w$ and quantity of labor supplied $(N)$

**AGGREGATE**: no. of workers $\times$ individuals working hrs
$N = T - \ell$
$c = w(T-\ell)+V$


**Budget Constraint:**
$$
c + w \ell = wT + V
$$
price of $\ell$ is real wage $w$

#### Income Effect
$V \uparrow,w\uparrow: \ell \uparrow, N \downarrow$
$V \downarrow,w\downarrow:\ell \downarrow, N\uparrow$
#### Substitution Effect
$w\uparrow:\ell \downarrow,N\uparrow$
$w\downarrow:\ell \uparrow, N \downarrow$

>if $w$ change is temporary SE dominates, if permanent IE dominates

#### Shifts of $N^S$
Factors
 - wealth 
 - expected future real wage $(w)$
 - individuals preference and taste
 - working-age population
 - Labor Force participation rate

>real wage shifts rapidly to equate $N^S$ and $N^D$ (eq)

solving strat: $N \implies N^d$
### Unemployment

**Frictional Unemployment**: voluntarily leave to look for better jobs

**Structural Unemployment**: workers losing their jobs due to shifts in the economy

**Natural Rate of unemployment**: unemployment rate at full-employment
- not contradictory because of frictional and structural U

**Cyclical Unemployment**: actual U - natural rate of U
