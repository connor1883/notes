### Investment

- cost benefit decision to additional unit of $K$ = MPK
- investment becomes K with lag $\implies MPK^f$ 

**User Cost of Capital**:  interest cost + deprecation
$$\Large{uc = rp_{k}+ \delta p_k}$$$MPK^f > uc$: Increase K
$MPK^{f}< uc:$ Decrease K

#### Desired Capital Stock ($MPK^{f}= uc$) 
$MPK^f$ downward sloping; $uc$ is constant
![[Pasted image 20240223143049.png|400]]

Factors that affect $MPK^f$ 
- Technological changes

Factors that affect $uc$
- changes in the $r, \delta$
- Taxes


#### Desired Investment
$$
\Large{I_{t}= (K^{*}- K_{t})+\delta K_t}
$$
Desired Investment = net increase in K + investment needed to replace depreciated capital


#### With Corporate Taxes

$$MPK^{f}= \frac{uc}{(1-\tau)}=\frac{(r+d)P_{k}}{1-\tau}$$
$\tau \uparrow: K \downarrow$

### Savings and Consumption
![[Pasted image 20240223143728.png|400]]
Saving allows for consumption smoothing

**Budget Constraint**
$$\Large{(1+r)c_{1}+ c_{2}= (1+r)Y_{1}+ Y_2}$$

- lifetime wealth: $(1+r)Y_{1}+ Y_2$ 
- price of current consumption determined by $r$

Consumption smoothing: $c_1 = c_2 = c$


**Marginal Propensity to Consume:**
- fraction of additional income a person consumes in current period
$MPC = \frac{\Delta c_{1}}{\Delta Y_1}$ estimated between 0 and 1


Savings in Period 1: 
$$
s_{1}= Y_{1}-c = \frac{Y_1-Y_2}{2+r}
$$
Factors that affect consumption and savings

$r:$ opposite IE for savers and borrowers, SE + IE make it ambiguous
- empirically $r\downarrow: c_{1}\uparrow$ slightly 



> Lump-Sum Tax

BC:
$\large{(1+r)c_{1}+ c_{2}= (1+r)Y_{1}+ Y_2-(1+r)\tau_{1}-\tau_{2}}$
lump sum tax does not affect individuals BC
$\tau_{1}\downarrow$ has to be balanced by future tax increases
$\implies$ lump-sum tax cuts do not affect $c_1$
***Ricardian Equivalence***


> National Savings

Private Savings = $(Y-T)-C$
Gov Savings = $T-G$

National Savings: $S_\text{pvt}+ S_\text{gov}$
$Y-C-G$
