assuming closed economy

total quantity of goods supplied = total quantity of goods demanded

$Y = C^{d}+ I^{d}+G$

(not the same as national income accounting)

$\implies Y-C^{d}-G = S^{d}=I^{d}$
Equilibrium at $S^{d}= I^{d}$

Investment curve is downwards sloping ($r$ and $I^d$ relationship)
Savings curve is upwards sloping (same reason)
