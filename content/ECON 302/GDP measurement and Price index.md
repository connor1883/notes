#### Product Approach
market value of final goods and services
- value added = market value of outputs - market value of inputs
#### Income Approach
Wages + Profits + Taxes
GDP = National Income + depreciation + statistical discrepancy - net factor payments from abroad
#### Expenditure Approach
GDP = C + I + G + NX

Fundamental identity of National Income Accounting
> Total production = total expenditure = total income

all three approaches are equivalent

Net Factor Payments from abroad: income earned by home residents working abroad - income paid out to foreigners working domestically

GNP = GDP + NFP

#### Price Indices 

GDP deflator = $100 \times \frac{\text{nominal GDP}}{\text{real GDP}}$

measures the prices of final goods and services during a period of time

other price indices

**CPI**
- fixed basket, base year

Core CPI: $-$food and energy

improvements in quality not captured by CPI
substitution is possible and not captured by CPI

**PCE**
similar to CPI but chain weighted index
also includes items and expenditures out of scope of CPI

Growth of Y between $t$ and $t +1$: (period $Y$)

$$
g_{Y}= \frac{Y_{t+1}-Y_{t}}{Y_{t}}= \frac{\Delta Y_{t+1}}{Y_t}
$$
annualized quarterly growth rate = $4(g_q)$

Inflation Rate:
$$
\pi_{t+1}=\frac{P_{t+1}-P_{t}}{P_t}=\frac{\Delta P_{t+1}}{P_t}
$$
where $P_t$ refers to the price index at time $t$

Inflation Rate = Growth rate of nominal GDP - Growth rate of real GDP

Inflation Rate = nominal interest rate - real interest rate
