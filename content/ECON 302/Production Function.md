### Cobb Douglass Production Function

$Y=AK^{\alpha}N^\beta$

$Y:$ real output produced in a given period of time
$K:$ quantity of capital used in period
$N:$ number of worker or labor hours

$A:$ total factor of productivity
- effectiveness of capital and labor
- affected by tech, gov reg, management

$MPK = \frac{\partial Y}{\partial k}$; this is also the slope of the production function
assuming diminishing marginal product of capital: as we increase $K$ it increases $Y$ but at a decreasing rate

**Returns to scale** (ALL INPUTS by SAME FACTOR)
- determined by sum of exponents
	- =  1 constant
	- <  1 decreasing
	- >  1 increasing


**Output Elasticity** ==JUST LOOK TO EXPONENT==
Output Elasticity of Capital
$$\frac{\Delta Y/Y}{\Delta K/K}=\frac{\partial \log(Y)}{\partial \log (K)}=\alpha$$
Output Elasticity of Labor
$$
\frac{\Delta Y/Y}{\Delta N/N}=\frac{\partial \log(Y)}{\partial \log(N)}=\beta
$$

### Shifts of Production Function

Supply Shocks
e.g. Weather change, gov reg, management
