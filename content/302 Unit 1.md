TO STUDY:

- start work on CS and focus on working through shifts
- checkmark looking line graphs
- might need to do further stuff depending on class

CS:
exponent to log formula

to max profits firms will: $MPK^{f}= (r+d)p_k$ ; $MPN = w$

also other considerations 

the $x$ returns to scale thing

$k^{*}=\left(\frac{s A}{r+\delta}\right) ^\frac{1}{1-\alpha}$ : steady state capital labor ratio

maybe growth rates at steady state algebra

make sure to go back to notes in notebook to make CS
- understanding cap accum eq. 
	- $i_t = y_t - c_t$
